            My favorite is "Eat That Frog" is written by Brian Tracy <br>
            Eat That Frog! is all about overcoming procrastination and learning to manage your time. It's normal to feel drowned in work, but when you learn to “eat your frogs” – meaning do your most important tasks first – you'll work more efficiently and be happier too.

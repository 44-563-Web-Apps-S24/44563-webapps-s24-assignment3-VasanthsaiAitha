            My favorite is "Eat That Frog" is written by Brian Tracy <br>
            Eat That Frog! is all about overcoming procrastination and learning to manage your time. It's normal to feel drowned in work, but when you learn to “eat your frogs” – meaning do your most important tasks first – you'll work more efficiently and be happier too.

        <p>To find the difference between two arrays in JavaScript,<br>
           you can iterate over one array using a for loop and check if each element exists in the other array using the indexOf() method.<br>
           If an element is not found, it is added to the result array.</p>
       <pre>
           const difference = (a, b) => {
               const s = new Set(b);
               return a.filter(x => !s.has(x));
             };
             
             difference([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]);
